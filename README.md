# Electron Password Generator

This is a simple password generator, which does not save your password anyway.

## What it does is:
1. Type your private key you wish to use for hashing.
2. Below, you type in your easy-to-remember password.
3. Then it will display an hashed password generated from the private key and the password you entered.
4. You can use the generated hash for any of your web application.  This way, your password is harder for hackers to guess.

## Benefits
This app does not save your private key or password.  If you remember them, you can always generate the same hashes, which you can then use.

## How to run
- Development: ```npm run start```
- Production: ```npm run build``` This will produce a dist folder.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
